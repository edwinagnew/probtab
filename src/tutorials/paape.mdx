## Pragmatic Armchair Epistemology

Imagine sitting comfortably in a deep armchair. You're sat by a crackling fireplace with a pipe in your mouth, philosophising away. You're wondering about wondering about all sorts of wonderful things. You're curious and fascinated by these concepts and thoughts but there's one problem. The thing is that you can't be bothered to get out of your armchair something something

The thesis of this essay is that computability/complexity theory can be interpreted as a theory of *a priori* epistemology. If none of those words mean anything to you, it's probably not worth reading on.

Let's break it down. Computability theory is about Turing machines and the limits of algorithms. Epistemology is the study of knowledge. *A priori* epistemology is, therefore, the study of knowledge without experience. What's the connection between these two? I imagine there's already alarm bells going off in your head. "Here comes another computer scientist claiming that everything is a computer". Except that's not what I'm claiming! Ironically, we'll see later that traditional epistemology actually assumes we're more like computers than I am. 

Epistemology: *S* knows $p$ iff:
1. *S* believes $p$.
2. $p$ is true.
3. *S*'s belief in $p$ is justified. 

Computability: $M$ knows $x$ iff $x \in X \iff M(x) = 1$. This breaks down as:
1. $M(x) = 1$.
2. $x \in X$
3. $\forall y \in X, M(y) = 1$. 

The point is that we do not talk of $M$'s knowledge of $x$, but of the whole language $X$. I argue this is a direct analogy to reliabilism: S knows $p$ iff S's process for believing in $p$ is generally accurate.
